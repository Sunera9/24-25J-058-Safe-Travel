# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
hen tourists visit Sri Lanka, they often opt to sample local cuisine from small, local vendors 
rather than large restaurants. However, it can be challenging to obtain information about local 
food items because there is no specific system for doing so. As a result, tourists may need to 
spend a lot of time searching online for information about local foods. This creates difficulties 
for tourists trying to experience local cuisine while traveling in the country. It is possible to 
identify several problems that have led to this situation.

➢ How to quickly get information about a specific food item?
➢ How to get the right information about food despite the language barrier?
➢How can tourists know if the food contains any allergens?
➢ How to find out how much of certain ingredients, such as sugar, are in the food?
➢ How to determine if the food is safe to eat or not?

```

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
To develop a reliable and user-friendly system  that enables tourists to independently 
identify the ingredients of local foods and assess their safety and compatibility with their 
personal health conditions, thereby preventing food poisoning and enhancing their overall travel 
experience.
