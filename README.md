# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
When tourists visit Sri Lanka's beaches, they engage in various activities such as swimming, sunbathing,
surfing, and boating. However, it can be difficult to determine whether the weather and sea conditions
are suitable for these activities. General weather forecasts provide broad information but lack the
specific insights needed for beach activities. As a result, tourists may face challenges in planning
their activities safely and enjoyably. This situation highlights several problems:

➢ How to predict the suitability of beaches for specific activities like swimming or surfing?
➢ How to ensure safety by identifying potential risks such as strong winds or high waves?
➢ How to make weather information more accessible and user-friendly for beachgoers?
➢ How to promote sustainable tourism by aligning activities with favorable conditions?
➢ How to provide accurate, activity-specific forecasts for tourists and local operators?

```

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
To develop a reliable and user-friendly prediction model that provides tourists and beachgoers with
activity-specific weather and sea condition forecasts, ensuring safety, enhancing their beach
experience, and promoting informed decision-making for activities like swimming, surfing, and boating.
