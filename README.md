# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
In Sri Lanka, tourism stands as one of the foremost revenue-generating sectors,
attracting visitors from all corners of the globe to experience its rich cultural heritage,
breathtaking landscapes, and warm hospitality. yet many tourists encounter difficulties
such as overpriced goods and scams perpetrated by locals.
However, there are many problems that tourists face when traveling in a country. One
of the main issues is the language barrier. In some developing countries, the lack of
English fluency due to limited education can prevent effective communication with
tourists. This can lead to misunderstandings, fights, or tourists being easily scammed
when buying items.
Another issue arises when traveling to less populated areas for activities such as hiking.
Most GPS applications do not provide accurate routes to these destinations, making it
easy for tourists to get lost.
Additionally, local foods can be very different from what tourists are used to. They need
to be cautious when trying these foods, as they might cause allergic reactions or illness.

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
This app helps tourists identify if a local person is likely to be aggressive, neutral, or
friendly by analyzing conversations with natural language processing. It evaluates word
usage to make assumptions about their character.
The Medical Allergies and Food Safety Detection feature assists tourists in making safe
food choices. Users can input their medical conditions and allergies, and the app will
analyze food images to identify ingredients and provide safety alerts.
The Overpriced Item Detection feature helps tourists avoid overpaying by collecting
price data and estimating average prices. Users can take a photo of an item, and the
app will identify it and display the average price to help them make informed decisions.
The navigation map uses GPS data to offer multiple route choices through different
terrains. Using machine learning, it selects the best route based on user preferences.
The map displays all routes for easy comparison, ensuring a safe and enjoyable trip
whether hiking, biking, or exploring nature
